<h1>Voluntary Work</h1>
<p>Our organisation is dependent on the contribution of new people, willing to support the work we are doing at the Kontakt- und Beratungsstelle für Flüchtlinge und Migrant_innen (KuB).</p>
<p>KuB is a self-governed project, which means we don't have a boss. The employees make decisions together, in meetings, considering all important questions. All employees must therefore be able to take responsibility for their own actions and the actions of the whole team.</p>

<h3>Application for Voluntary Work</h3>
<p>We especially welcome applications from refugees and migrants.</p>
<p>Please send your application to: <a href="mailto:kontakt@kub-berlin.org">kontakt@kub-berlin.org</a><br>Contact: Sarah Abel, Stephen Sulimma</p>
</aside>
<p>KuB has many working groups (FGs). At the moment we are looking for support in the following fields:</p>
<h3>Team Legal Advice</h3>
<p>We are looking for people that support the refugees and migrants with questions about the procedure for the right of asylum, right of residence and social assistance law.</p>
<p>For legal trainees we can also be a training place for the elective station.</p>
<p>The following skills and experiences are helpful for this work:</p>
<ul>
<li>judicial knowledge</li>
<li>practical experiences</li>
<li>knowledge of languages, especially: Albanian, Arabic, Dari/Farsi, Kurdish (Kurmanji/Sorani), Russian</li>
</ul>
<h3>Team Psychosocial Counseling</h3>
<p>We offer a low-threshold psychosocial counseling service that includes both a consultation hour (initial talks) and individual counseling appointments. We see ourselves as the first point of contact for people with a refugee or migration background who feel psychologically burdened and would like to talk to someone about it. An important part of our work is also to refer these people to appropriate services according to their wishes and needs.</p>
<p>We are looking for people with …</p>
<ul>
<li>experience with Psychology/Social Pedagogics/...  or motivation to acquire it</li>
<li>an attitude critical of racism and paternalism towards those seeking advice, readiness for self-critical confrontation with one's own prejudices, sensitive handling of various experiences of discrimination</li>
<li>perspective of being able to work with us for at least 1 year</li>
<li>enough time for:
<ul>
<li>At least one individual psychosocial counseling session (weekly or every two weeks, can be scheduled flexibly)</li>
<li>Regular communication within the team via email</li>
<li>one team meeting per month (Tuesday evenings)</li>
<li>one supervision meeting every two months (Tuesday evenings)</li>
<li>optionally you are also invited to do the initial interviews from time to time (Mondays 9-11am)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can imagine this, we would be happy to hear from you! Send a short (informal) application, in which you introduce yourself, describe your motivation and possibly previous experience and language skills, to <a href="mailto:psb@kub-berlin.org">psb@kub-berlin.org</a>.</p>
<h3>Team Translation and Support</h3>
<div class="system-module">mitarbeit-sprachmittlung</div>
<h3>Team German Courses</h3>
<p>We are looking for <strong>volunteer teachers</strong> who have the time and would like to support our work in the field of German as a foreign language (DaF) on a longer-term basis.</p>
<p>The target group of our language courses are all refugees and migrants who, for reasons of residence and various other reasons, have no or no easy access to other language courses. Our Alpha &amp; A1 to B2 courses are offered free of charge and unbureaucratically for people of all ages without any barriers to admission, attendance or other barriers.</p>
<p>You don't need an education as a language teacher and you don't necessarily need any previous teaching experience. The main thing is that you bring joy, commitment, intercultural understanding and open-mindedness as well as 2-3 hours of time per week.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please contact us at <a href="mailto:fg-deutschkurse@kub-berlin.org">fg-deutschkurse@kub-berlin.org</a>. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>
<h3>Project „Understanding bureaucratic forms“</h3>
<p>We translate bureaucratic forms in different languages. The translations help refugees and migrants, when applying for benefits of the asylum seeker benefits act (Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz).</p>
<p>We are looking for translaters. At the moment we need particular support with translations in the following languages: Arabic, Dari, Fasi, Russian, Tigrinya, Turkish</p>
<h3>Office / Initial contact</h3>
<p>During opening hours, the office is always staffed. The work is divided into two "shifts": The first office duty is from 8:30 a.m. - 1 p.m. and the second office duty is from 1 p.m. - 5 p.m.</p>
<p>On Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, people come to the office to register for open counseling hours. In the afternoon we take care of all kinds of other tasks. We are always approachable.</p>
<p>The office tasks are pretty diverse. The office-team is responsible for the communication within and outside KuB. Some of our tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to give information over the phone</li>
<li>to welcome people to the open counseling hours in the morning</li>
<li>to offer drinks to people who seek counsel and be approachable for any problems</li>
<li>to give information about any KuB offers</li>
<li>to be approachable for all colleagues at KuB</li>
<li>to translate and explain letters to people who seek counsel (for example from a public office)</li>
<li>to find people who can accompany someone to public offices and translate for them</li>
<li>to support counselors in their work</li>
<li>Provide people who seek advice with contacts to other counseling centers or to lawyers</li>
</ul>
<p>Necessary skills for the office work:</p>
<ul>
<li>to be open minded</li>
<li>ability to communicate</li>
<li><strong>a certain "chaos resistens"</strong></li>
<li><strong>sensibility in the contact with people (especially with people being in difficult circumstances)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Language skills are helpful, but not required necessarily. At a first meeting we would speak about the extend of your work and further details.</p>
<h3>Team Administration</h3>
<p>Because the KuB is now quite big, we also have to take care of a lot of administration. To strengthen our administration team, we are looking for people who have experience with funding acquisition, project management, accounting, controlling and association law.</p>
