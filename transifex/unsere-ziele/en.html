<h1>Our Aims</h1>
<p>We want to support refugees and migrants who are seeking advice, so that they can live in Germany independently and take responsibility for their life here.</p>
<p>Examples of what we offer to refugees and migrants, are: consultations on the right of residence, psychological support and German language classes.</p>
<p>We work with integrated methods. Our social work is centred on the person.</p>
<p>The people we advise are independent, able to take responsibility for themselves and develop strategies for their own lives. We support and advise them.</p>
<p>Refugees and migrants often live on the margins of German society. Their situations are often precarious. We think we need to change this situation.</p>
<p>The team of KuB is commited to ensuring…</p>
<ul>
<li>…the understanding between the people in Berlin.</li>
<li>…the reduction of prejudice and discrimination.</li>
<li>…the integration of refugees and migrants into the Berlin society.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to these aims in our private, social and political life.</p>
<p>We fight against racism and other forms of discrimination, such as anti-Semitism, age discrimination, sexism and homophobia.</p>
<p>We want to achieve these aims through the range of our activities.</p>
<p>All the services that KuB offers are free of charge.</p>
