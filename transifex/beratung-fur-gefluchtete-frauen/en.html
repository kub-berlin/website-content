<p>We are also located in the offices of KuB. For our consultation we create a safe and secure atmosphere. Together we work out how you can solve your problems, focusing on what is most important for you.</p>
<p>Our female consultants have lots of experience. They will look at your whole situation and support you accordingly.</p>
<p>We assist you along your path to finding a solution. For example we have people who can accompany you to administrative offices / authorities, doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>We also have language helpers. They will translate for you from German to your language and vice versa, during a consultation or at the authorities. The interpreters know and understand your situation.</p>
<p>If you feel more comfortable you can ask for a consultation anonymously. You do not have to tell us your name.</p>
