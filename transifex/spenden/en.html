<h3>Become an independent sponsor of the KuB!</h3>
<p>We want to support refugees and migrants in the long term, without being dependent on political parties or bureaucratic and uncertain project funding. For this we need regular donations. Therefore, we are looking for solidaric people who support us with a fixed monthly amount.</p>

<h3>Notes on donations</h3>
<p>Depending on the provider, there are fees of 2.5% to 5% for each donation, so that less money reaches us than you have donated. The lowest fees are charged for transfers directly to our bank account. You can also donate via the <a href="https://spenden.twingle.de/kontakt-und-beratungsstelle-fur-fluchtlinge-und-migrant-innen-e-v/kub-spenden-allgemein/tw64df2b7d9f960/widget">donation form</a> or <a href="https://www.betterplace.org/de/projects/20142-fluchtlinge-und-migranten-unterstutzen-und-beraten-spende-fur-die-kub">Betterplace</a>.</p>
<p>If you donate by bank transfer, we do not have your contact details, so you will not receive any further notification. However, you are very welcome to send us your contact details by <a href="mailto:kontakt@kub-berlin.org">email</a> after your donation. You can also let us know whether you need a donation receipt.</p>
