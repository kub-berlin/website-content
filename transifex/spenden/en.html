You can find more information about how we use donations in our <a href="/de/transparenz/">transparency report</a>.</p>
<h3>Independent sponsors of the KuB</h3>
<p>We seek independent financing for the KuB so that we can provide support for migrants in challenging situations and refugees in the long term. Our finances should be less dependent on the parties in government project funding. To achieve this goal, we want to build a group of people who stand with us in solidarity, and who support us financially with monthly donations.</p>
