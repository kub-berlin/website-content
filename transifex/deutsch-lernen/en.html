<p>You can enroll in our courses at consultation hours. You need an appointment for the that. You can enroll for summer semester from March and for winter semester from September.</p>
<h4>Consultation hours</h4>
<p>During the consultation we will check with you which level you need and if our courses are suitable for you. If there are free places, you can enroll. Or you can get advice about other German courses in Berlin.</p>
<p>To make an appointment for consultation, come to KuB or send an email to <a href="mailto:dk-anmeldungen@kub-berlin.org">dk-anmeldungen@kub-berlin.org</a>.</p>
