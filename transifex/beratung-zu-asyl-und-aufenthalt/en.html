<h3>Please note that:</h3>
<ul>
<li>You have to come in person to the KuB office at Oranienstraße 159. We do not offer advice over the phone or by email.</li>
<li>For advice, come during our consulting hours: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m..</li>
<li>Our consultancy services are usually very busy. We therefore advise you to come early in the morning; it's best to be here already by 9:00 a.m..</li>
<li>Please be patient while waiting for a consultation. Depending on the daily demand it could take some time until it's your turn for a consultation.</li>
<li>Sometimes, it can happen that we are not even able to give you a consultation on that day, due to the number of people. We would ask for your understanding in such cases.</li>
<li>Please make sure you bring all relevant important documents to the consultation. Examples could be:
<ul>
<li>documents from the BAMF (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge), from the Ausländerbehörde, from the Jobcenter, etc.</li>
<li>letters from your lawyer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What we do not offer:
<ul>
<li>We don't do searches for apartments.</li>
<li>We don't do job hunting for you.</li>
<li>We don't take on any court cases for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you feel you can't talk to the people at the authorities, for example: Jobcenter or Ausländerbehörde - because you can't speak German well enough, or not at all? Do you feel insecure about going alone to the authorities, for example to the Jobcenter or Ausländerbehörde? <strong>In that case we could arrange for someone to accompany you to the authority.</strong> However, you would have to first come to us in person, for a consultation</p>

<h3>Information for People from European Union (European Union Citizens) and their Families</h3>
<p>Every district in Berlin has an advice and information centre for people who are European citizens. These information centres also assist people with a secure prospect of a residence permit status in Germany.</p>
<p>The social workers in these information centres are very familiar with the types of questions asked by European citizens and their families. For example they assist with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with public authorities/ government agencies</li>
<li>Questions concerning school and education, employment, health or German classes.</li>
</ul>
