<li>Do you have issues talking to people at the authorities (e.g. Jobcenter or Ausländerbehörde), because you speak no or only a little German? Do you feel insecure about going alone to the authorities? <strong>In that case we can arrange for someone to accompany you to the authorities.</strong> However, you first have to come to us in person for counseling.</li>

<h3>Information for People from European Union (European Union Citizens) and their Families</h3>
<p>Every district in Berlin has an advice and information centre for people who are European citizens. These information centres also assist people with a secure prospect of a residence permit status in Germany.</p>
<p>The social workers in these information centres are very familiar with the types of questions asked by European citizens and their families. For example they assist with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problems with public authorities/ government agencies</li>
<li>Questions concerning school and education, employment, health or German classes.</li>
</ul>
