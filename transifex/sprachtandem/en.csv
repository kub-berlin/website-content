People interested in your offer can now contact you via our portal. We will forward requests with contact details to you. Then you will be able to decide whether to conatct the person directly.

Language Tandem provided by KuB aims to enable interactions free of discrimination. It matters to us that personal privacy and boundaries are respected. Sexual content is not appropriate for Language Tandem! It is not a platform for finding a partner! It can happen that someone does not abide by the rules. Therefore, please don't give any important data to people you don't know. Only provide your address, phone number or name if you trust the other person. It is safer to have your first meeting online. You can use platforms like Jitsi: https://meet.systemli.org
If you have any negative experiences at a meeting, please report this to: sprachtandem@kub-berlin.org

We wish you lots of success and fun with %s-Language-Tandem!

Best wishes,

%s-Language-Tandem-Team
