<h2>Research Project "SpAM"</h2>
<p>SpAM is the „research group“ of KuB. SpAM stands for speculation, abstraction and metaphyics. The aim of the group SpAm is it to theoretically reflect on the social work with migrants which is a day to day business of KuB: what are its conditions, forms and possibilities?</p>
<p>KuB deals with this and other topics internally, as well as externally with theorists working in the field of social work with migrants and with interested members of the public. SpAM is doing this especially within the scope of public events like KuB-Thementag and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16:veroeffentlichungen&amp;catid=10&amp;Itemid=152">publications</a>.</p>
