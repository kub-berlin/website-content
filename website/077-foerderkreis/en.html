<h1>Financing for the KuB uncertain! Support us with a regular donation!</h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 27 November 2021</em></p>
<p>Dear friends of the KuB,</p>
<p>As you are certainly aware, we at the Kontakt- und Beratungsstelle für Flüchtlinge und Migrant_innen e.V. (KuB) have provided assistance to refugees and migrants from around the world since 1983. It is important to us that we are able to provide consultation to people regardless of their residence status.</p>
<p>We hope to achieve financing for the KuB that is independent from political majorities and project-based funding so that we can offer long-term support to refugees and migrants in difficult situations. To achieve this goal, we hope to establish a group of benefactors with likeminded individuals who will support us with a fixed, monthly donation.</p>
<hr class="system-read-more">
<p>We currently assist around 3000 individuals per year in their efforts to obtain a secure residential status as well as social and financial equality. At the same time, we help them with social and psychosocial counselling in addition to courses for learning German.</p>
<p>After the KuB operated on an entirely voluntary basis for about 30 years, we have received funding since 2015. Paid activities at the KuB are largely financed through project proposals. These projects have opened up many doors for us, but are also frequently problematic.</p>
<ul>
<li>We say this because there is little predictability, as projects only last for 1-2 years, and by the time the project is over it is uncertain whether it will be extended. Because of the ongoing coalition negotiations, it is not yet clear whether our projects will continue to receive uninterrupted funding as of January. There is a declaration of obligation by the Senate, but a definitive decision concerning the continued funding for the KuB is only expected to be announced in summer 2022, after the Berlin House of Representatives passes its new budget. This affects 10 women's and legal counselling positions that we cannot manage on our own. We would have to dismiss most of our staff at least temporarily.</li>
<li>The funding conditions of many benefactors exclude many of our beneficiaries seeking advice. Funding is also only directed toward persons with good prospects of residency, with no regard for the fact that persons whose asylum applications have been denied or who are subject to deferred deportation also require counselling. It is even more difficult to find funding for psychosocial counselling or German courses, as beneficiaries are referred to the general (but insufficient) healthcare system or German courses for persons with residential status. In addition to these obstacles, the criteria for funding have become stricter in recent years.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to achieve financing for the KuB that is independent from political majorities and project-based funding so that we can offer long-term support to refugees and migrants in difficult situations. To achieve this goal, we hope to establish a group of benefactors with likeminded individuals who will support us with a fixed, monthly donation. The members of this group will receive regular updates. We would also be happy to speak with you personally – you have surely had an idea or two that can benefit the KuB and its beneficiaries. If you would like to join the group of benefactors, <a href="/images/documents/SpendenvereinbarungF%C3%B6rderkreisKuB.pdf">download the donation agreement here</a>, fill it out, and return it to us. We would be very pleased to have your support!</p>
<p>Of course, you can also set up a standing order with your bank to make a regular donation. The amounts and donations are tax-deductible. Please support us in making our important work more independent! Monthly donations make it possible for us to plan optimally and work independently. We would also be very grateful if you share our call for donations with your friends, acquaintances, family, and coworkers. Thank you very much for your support!</p>
