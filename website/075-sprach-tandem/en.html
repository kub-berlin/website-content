<p>The language tandem by KuB wants to enable an exchange without discrimination. It is important to us that the boundaries of the other person are respected.</p>
<p>The language tandem is not a place for sexual content!</p>
<p>It is not a dating site!</p>
<p>It can happen that a person does not follow the rules. Therefore, please do not give important data to people you do not know. Only give your address, phone number and name if you can trust the other person. It is safer if the first meeting takes place online. You can do this with <a href="https://meet.systemli.org/">Jitsi</a>, for example.</p>
<p>If you have any negative experiences at your meetings, please contact: <a href="mailto:sprachtandem@kub-berlin.org">sprachtandem@kub-berlin.org</a></p>
