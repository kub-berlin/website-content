<p>Dear everyone interested in improving your German language skills,</p>
<p>right now, we are able to offer you a couple of vacant slots in our regular classes. Due to the pandemic situation, the courses take place online, so in order to participate, you will need a computer and a fast and stable internet connection.</p>
<p>If you have access to both, and would like to participate, please send an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:dk-anmeldungen@kub-berlin.org">dk-anmeldungen@kub-berlin.org</a></p>
<p>The only information we need for your registration are your name, a contact e-mail address and the language level youâ€™re interested in.</p>
<p>Courses available are:</p>
<p>A 1.2 -&gt; Tuesdays from 5 to 7 pm</p>
<p>A 2.1 -&gt; Mondays from 7 to 9 pm</p>
<p>B 1 -&gt; Wednesdays from 7 to 9 pm</p>
<p>In case you are not sure about your language level, there are many free online tests, where you can check your current level, e.g.:</p>
