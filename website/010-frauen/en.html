<ul>
<li>Pregnant people</li>

</ul>
<p>We support you in the offices of KuB. We create a safe and secure atmosphere. Together we work out how you can solve your problems, focusing on what is most important to you.</p>
<p>Our female counselors have lots of experience. They will look at your whole situation and support you accordingly.</p>
<p>We assist you along your path to finding a solution. For example we have people who can accompany you to administrative offices / authorities, doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>We also have interpreters. They will translate for you from German to your language and vice versa, at KuB or at the authorities. The interpreters know and understand your situation.</p>
<p>If you prefer, the support can also be anonymous. You do not have to tell us your name.</p>
<p>KuB is part of the <a href="https://bns.berlin/">Berlin Network for Vulnerable Refugees</a>. Within this network, KuB is the specialized unit for supporting women in need. KuB cooperates with <a href="https://www.bbzberlin.de/">BBZ</a>, a counseling and support center for young and minor age refugees.</p>
