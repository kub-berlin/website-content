<h3>Our winter semester 2022/2023 courses</h3>
<p>All German courses meet twice a week. Each class is two hours long. All courses are in-person courses. Except for A2.2, in which the first class for the week takes places in person and the second class for the week takes place online. All classes take place in the afternoon or evening.</p>
<p><strong>Literacy training (in person)</strong> Wednesdays 19:00–21:00 and Fridays 17:00–19:00</p>
<p><strong>A1.1 (in person)</strong> Tuesdays 15:00–17:00 and Wednesdays 15:00–17:00</p>
<p><strong>A1.2 (in person)</strong> Mondays 17:00–19:00 and Wednesdays 17:00–19:00</p>

<p><strong>B1 (in person)</strong> Tuesdays 15:00–17:00 and Thursdays 19:00–21:00</p>
<p>Because capacity in our courses is limited, we want to prioritise individuals who may struggle to register for other German courses due to their residency status or their financial income.</p>
<p>Please note! We do not offer any integration courses and we cannot issue any official language certificates. If you need one, we can issue you a certificate of participation.</p>
