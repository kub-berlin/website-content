<h1>Art Projects for Young People</h1>
<p>We offer different art projects. Especially for children that live in refugee camps. These projects are about painting, crafting, dancing, or making music.</p>
<p>With our art projects we give the participants a safe place. This way they can develop their creative capabilities. They discover, realise and strengthen their own ressources and abilities. They gain self-esteem and trust in themselves, as well as in others and the staff members of KuB.</p>
