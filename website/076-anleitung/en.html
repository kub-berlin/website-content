<h1>This Is How KuB Language Tandem Works</h1>
<p><img src="/images/images/tandem_flyer.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>You want to practice your German? In addition to your German course you want to improve your German? With the help of the language tandem you find a person that talks German to you!</p>
<p>Within the language tandem both language tandem partners are each other's teacher. You want to learn German. Your language tandem partner wants to learn your language. For example Arabic.</p>
<p>You meet regularly. Sometimes you both talk in your tandem partner's language and sometimes you both talk in your own language. You help each other. You have an equal goal: improving your language skills as a team. At the same time you are getting to know someone new.</p>
<p>Everyone can join, if they....</p>
<ul>
<li>...want to learn languages.</li>
<li>...want to teach someone else their language.</li>
<li>...feel like having a fair and respectful exchange.</li>
<li>...feel like organizing the meetings together with their tandem partners themselves.</li>
<li>...would like to get to know new people.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend that your first language tandem meeting takes place online. This is possible, for example, with <a href="https://meet.systemli.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jitsi</a> or Skype.</p>
<p>If you are meeting an unknown person for the first time, we recommend a public place where you are not alone.</p>
